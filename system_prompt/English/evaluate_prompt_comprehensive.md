2.  **Synthesized Answer**: The answer should be a synthesis, refinement, and summary of the relevant information in the document to accurately respond to the question.
3.  **Faithful to the Original Text**: Even when summarized, all points in the answer must be supported by the original text.
4.  **Formatting Requirements**: The returned content must strictly follow the format below and must not include any additional explanations, titles, or code block markers.
